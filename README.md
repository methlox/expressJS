This project is a simple api implementation using only ExpressJS framework. 

It uses Jest for unit testing parts of the application. 

The application consisted of login and authorization routes with third party application (discord) and also local authorization process (only one implemented at a time).
Loved learning Jest, which was completely new to me!
